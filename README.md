# Enhanced Ear Sensor System for Exercise Monitoring

## Overview

This project implements an advanced ear sensor system that combines physiological monitoring with machine learning to provide real-time exercise analysis and coaching. The system uses in-ear microphones (IEM) and inertial measurement units (IMU) to monitor breathing patterns, heart rate variability, and movement patterns during physical activity.

## Core Concept

The ear sensor system leverages the unique acoustic and motion sensing capabilities of the ear canal to monitor exercise performance non-intrusively. By analyzing respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), locomotor-respiratory coupling (LRC), and movement patterns, the system provides comprehensive fitness insights and personalized coaching.

   - Enables repetition counting and form analysis
   - Tracks gait patterns and movement quality
